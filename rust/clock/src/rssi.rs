//! Shared RSSI smoothing + proximity mapping for the roster-consuming screens
//! (#58 Marauder's Watch, #60 treasure-hunt).
//!
//! App-layer, `espnow`-only: a pure consumer of the roster
//! [`crate::net::mode::RadioManager`] already tracks — **no new frames, no radio
//! traffic**. Both screens share ONE smoother + one proximity mapping so the two
//! features read identically (a peer is exactly as "near" on the Watch as it is on
//! the treasure-hunt).
//!
//! Raw ESP-NOW RSSI swings ±5–10 dB frame-to-frame from multipath, so an
//! exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) is applied per peer before any
//! bar/word/trend is derived. All integer math — no `f32` on the `no_std` path.

/// EWMA factor as a /256 fixed-point numerator. α ≈ 0.30 → `77/256`. A new sample
