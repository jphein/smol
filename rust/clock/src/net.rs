//! Network module: WiFi + SNTP (Phase 2) and ESP-NOW + radio switching
//! (Phase 3). Everything here is feature-gated so the default Phase 1 build
//! pulls in none of the esp-wifi stack.
//!
//! Design note: `esp_hal::init()` may only run once and hands out the
//! peripheral singletons. `main` owns that call and passes the radio-related
//! peripherals into this module, so we never double-initialise the HAL.
