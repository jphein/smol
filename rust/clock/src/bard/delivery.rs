//! bard (#302): HOW the narration is delivered — reveal speed and the inf/page mode — plus the
//! strict parser for the CFG `V` value that carries both.
//!
//! Pure, `no_std`, alloc-free and host-tested: this is a parser for bytes that arrive from a broker
//! over the air, so "strict and panic-free" is the whole specification. A refusal must keep the
//! previous setting (the caller's job) and say which field was wrong (this module's job).
//!
//! Wire format: `<ms_per_char>:<mode>[:<font>]`, e.g. `160:inf`, `80:page`, `120:inf:9x15`.
//!   * the FONT field is OPTIONAL, so every value already retained on a broker (`120:inf`) keeps
//!     parsing and keeps its font — a new field must never invalidate a fleet's stored config.
//!   * EMPTY value ⇒ every default (the house "empty = board default" convention, as `S` and `T`).
//!   * an EMPTY FIELD ⇒ that field's default: `:page` sets the mode and leaves the speed alone,
//!     `80:` the reverse. Cheap to support and it saves the dashboard from having to know both.
//!   * the colon is REQUIRED otherwise — a bare `160` is refused rather than guessed at, because
//!     guessing is how `page` would one day be read as a speed.
//!   * speed out of range is CLAMPED, not refused (`Accepted::clamped` says so, for the log): the
//!     range exists to stop a 0 pegging the reveal loop, and refusing a well-meant 1000 would be
//!     less useful than honouring it as 500.
