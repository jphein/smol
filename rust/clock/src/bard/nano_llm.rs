//! bard (#300) core: the SBRD v1 model container.
//!
//! One flash-resident blob (`model/stories260K-q8.bin`, produced by
//! `tools/bard_export_model.py`) holds everything the storyteller needs: the header, the
//! packed tok512 table, the f32 RMSNorm weights and the int8 weight matrices with their f32
//! group scales. `Model::parse` validates it once and hands back BORROWED views — nothing is
//! copied, so a 277 KB model costs 277 KB of flash and ~0 bytes of RAM to open.
//!
//! Layout (little-endian throughout; see the exporter for the authoritative description):
//! ```text
//!   0  u32 magic = b"SBRD"          4  u32 version = 1
//!   8  u32 dim, hidden, n_layers, n_heads, n_kv_heads, vocab, seq_len, gs, shared_cls  (9)
//!  44  u32 tok_bytes                48  tokenizer section, then 0-pad to 4-byte alignment
//!      f32 norms: rms_att[L][dim] · rms_ffn[L][dim] · rms_final[dim]
//!      q8 families, in this order — for EACH family, i8 data for ALL layers contiguously,
//!      THEN the f32 scales for ALL layers contiguously:
//!         tok_emb · wq · wk · wv · wo · w1 · w2 · w3 · (wcls only if !shared_cls)
//!            family i8   = n_total          bytes, n_total = n_layers * (rows * in)
//!            family f32s = n_total/gs * 4   bytes
//!      u32 crc32 of every preceding byte
//! ```
//!
//! ⚠️ FAMILY-GROUPED, NOT PER-MATRIX INTERLEAVED. llama2.c's `export.py` writes `q,s` per
//! MATRIX (q₀ s₀ q₁ s₁ …); SBRD writes one i8 block then one scale block per FAMILY. So a
//! layer's scales are NOT at `family_start + layer_i8_len` — reading floats just past a
//! layer's i8 data lands in the NEXT layer's i8 data. Address a weight as
//! `i8[family_i8 + layer*numel + row*in + k]` and its scale as
//! `f32[family_scales + (layer*numel + row*in + k)/gs]`, i.e. ONE flattened index per family
//! that runs across layer boundaries.
//!
//! Quantization groups run over that flattened data, so a group may straddle ROW boundaries
//! (it does here: w2's in-dim is 172, not a multiple of gs=64) — consumers must index scales
//! by flattened position, never per row. Groups never straddle a LAYER or MATRIX boundary,
//! because each matrix's numel is a multiple of `gs` (checked by the exporter and re-checked
//! here), which is also why the per-family flattened index equals
//! `layer * numel/gs + (row*in + k)/gs`. See the exporter's docstring for the full rationale.

/// Compile-time maxima: the statically-sized buffers the forward pass will use are cut to

/// on a tale: the cache is a ring, the narrator never stops, and this number is the length of its
/// memory rather than the length of its stories.
///
/// 80, and every earlier guess about this number was wrong in the same direction. The bench
/// (T13, stack-paint instrumentation) measured what the firmware ACTUALLY uses:
///
///   stack high-water 54,856 B — WiFi burst + crown duty + three stories
///   151 ms/token average, 170 ms worst; the mesh held crown throughout
///
/// So ~55 KB of stack is the real requirement, and the 14,240 B that `SEQ_CAP=160` left would
/// have been overrun by nearly 4×. No cache depth alone fixes that: the DRAM had to come from
/// the esp-wifi heap as well (128 → 96 KiB, `net::init_heap`, JP's call 2026-07-27 — see the
/// comment there). Together they buy back ~62 KB of stack against a 73,728 B floor that
/// `tools/repro_build.sh` now enforces from the measured peak (54,856 × 4/3).
///
/// The trade JP chose was FLEET-WIDE SHORT STORIES — and #302 then made the length question moot:
/// with a ring cache a tale runs as long as the reader wants, so 80 buys the model three or four
/// sentences of MEMORY (what it can still refer back to) rather than a whole story's length.

/// host (`cargo run --example bard_continue`: 12 seeds narrated well past the window, scored in

/// context — the cheapest detector of the way a 260K model fails: 84.4% at 0, 81.3% at 4, 85.0% at
/// 16. That is noise, not a signal — StreamingLLM's attention-sink result is about 7B-class models
/// whose first token carries a massive activation, and nothing at this size reproduced it.
///
/// So the tie is broken on the two things that ARE certain rather than on prose:
///   * a sink costs window — 16 pinned slots is 20% of the context a 260K model has to hold a
///     sentence together, permanently;
///   * a sink costs GEOMETRY. Its distance from the query grows without bound, so RoPE gets
///     extrapolated past the 512 positions the checkpoint was trained for — exactly the regime
///     the `SEQ_CAP <= c.seq_len` assert in [`Session::forward`] exists to keep us out of. At
///     `KEEP = 0` the widest relative distance is `SEQ_CAP - 1` FOREVER, so a story of any length
///     only ever asks the model for geometry it has seen.
///
/// Kept as a named constant, not folded away, because it is the knob to try first if a future
