//! #181 mesh-ledger FIRMWARE WIRING — binds the pure, host-tested L1/L2/L3 cores
//! ([`super::ledger`] #182 hash-chain · [`super::treehead`] #183 CT-Merkle anchor · [`super::sth`]
//! #184 ed25519 Signed-Tree-Head) into the running firmware. The cores are pure (sha256 + ed25519
//! *injected*, no HAL); this module supplies the concrete injections — `sha2` (the same crate the
//! OTA path uses) and `ed25519-compact` — and owns the per-node state.
//!
//! ## What a node does with the ledger
//! - **L1:** each node keeps its OWN tamper-evident append-only chain in `.bss` (resets at boot —
//!   it is a within-session provenance log, gossip/persistence is the HW-gated follow-up).
//! - **L2/L3 (crown):** the crown folds the head-set into a Merkle anchor and, IF it has an
//!   on-device ed25519 key ([provisioned at a JP-supervised USB touch](crate::ota) — never in CI,
//!   the repo, MQTT, or logs), signs it into a Signed-Tree-Head.
//! - **verify-what-you-sign:** before surfacing an STH the crown re-verifies its OWN signature AND
//!   an inclusion proof of its own head under the signed root — a self-consistency gate that also
//!   exercises the full verify half of the cores (so nothing is dead-code in this binary crate).
//!
//! ## Key provisioning (the #181-L3 gate — NO key generation here)
//! The signing key is a 32-byte ed25519 SEED read from NVS ([`crate::ota::resolve_ledger_key`]),
//! seeded ONLY by a deliberate USB-touch provisioning step. A node with no key runs verify-only /
//! publishes an UNSIGNED anchor — never fabricates a key. The seed never leaves the device.
